Description: High-throughput sequencing experiments followed by differential 
    expression analysis is a widely used approach to detect genomic biomarkers. 
    A fundamental step in differential expression analysis is to model the 
    association between gene counts and covariates of interest. NBAMSeq a 
    flexible statistical model based on the generalized additive model and 
    allows for information sharing across genes in variance estimation.
